# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the github repository with the project assignment for the course 
Getting and Cleaning Data part of the data science specialization in Coursera

## How to run the script

* Download and install in R the Required R-packages:

    - dplyr

* Get the project from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/josezambrana/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project.git
```

* Inside the project's directory download and unzip the dataset file:

```
wget https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip -O dataset.zip
unzip dataset.zip
```

* On R enviroment call setwd() to point to the project's directory.
* Run the script using: source("run_analysis.R")
* The script will:

  - Create a data frame called `dataset`, which contains the dataset generated by the steps 1 to 4.
  - Create a data frame called `result`, which contains the dataset generated by the step 5
  - Write a file called `dataset.txt` which contains the tidy dataset generated by the step 5.


## Description of the script

#### Step 1.

* Reads traing data, its labels and the subjects and join them all in a single data frame stored in a variable called `training`.
* Reads test data, its labels and the subsjects and join them all in a single data frame stored in a variable called `test`.
* Joins both data frame training and test in a single dataframe called `dataset`.

#### Step 2.

* Reads the data for measurements from features.txt.
* Creates a boolean vector to select only measurements on the mean or standard deviation.
* Modifies the dataset to get only columns for measurement on the mean or standard deviation, also activity and subject columns.

#### Step 3.

* Reads the activity labels data
* Parse Activity column as factor
* Set levels using activity labels data.

#### Step 4.

* Using features dataset names the column.

#### Step 5.

* with the resulting dataset in step 4 and using dplyr library, the script 
  calculates mean for all columns grouping by activity and subject.
* Writes the result in a file called `dataset.txt`
